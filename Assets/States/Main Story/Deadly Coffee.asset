  storyText: "You manage to get into the Cafe, and block the main entrance door. The
    place seems safe for the time being. and secure as well. You can hear the zombies
    punching at the door to get in. But the door is sturdy enough to hold them off.
    The officer gets a signal from the radio that they are evacuating civilians at
    the police station, and that the last van will be out in an hour! You can see
    that the back door leads to an alley that leads to the main street where the police
    station is located, but the horde is headed that way. You can wait until it passes
    by and get out from the front door to find another way, but you will lose time
    to get to the evacuation vehicles.\r\nYou decide it's best to:\r\n\r\n1. Get through
    the back door (may be quicker but dangerous to cross paths with the horde).\r\n2.
    Wiait and get trough the front door"
