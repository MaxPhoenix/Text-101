  storyText: "You shout to warn the officer, but now more zombies are coming to you,
    and you are still trying to get free, the officer turns arround and makes a quick
    shot in the zombie's head, and it was killed instantly, As you are trying to get
    free, another zombie grabs your hand, and you push it away, but it gets up and
    comes back for you. Feeling relieved of your warning, the rushes on your rescue,
    shooting the zombies arround you and the one grabing you in the head. He thanks
    you about you saving him and you thank him too . You see more zombies coming towards
    you. You see you can hide in the Cafe or in a Pharmacy You see that the Pharmacy
    can't be a good place to wait for the horde to pass by since it only has a glass
    window that may not be sturdy enough, but may have supplies that may help.\r\n\r\nYou
    decide to:\r\n1. Go into the pharmacy.(may give you less time to hide, but get
    some supplies).\r\n2. Hide into the Cafe (safer but may have anything useful)"
